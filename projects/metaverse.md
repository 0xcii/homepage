## Connected ecosystems

The full interoperability of our IOTABOTS and other NFTs projects enables endless possibilities for extensions and new projects which builds their own ecosystem. These connected ecosystems are the foundation of the Metaverse.

In order to maintain law and order, the following 4 rules apply in the Metaverse:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

And the most important law:

0. A robot may not injure humanity nor earth, or, by inaction, allow humanity or earth to come to harm.

This means that the ultimate goal of a robot is to protect humanity and the environment of the earth.

Keep that in mind and have fun!
