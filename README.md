# IOTABOTS Website

This is the repository for the IOTABOTS website on [www.iotabots.io](https://www.iotabots.io).

You can contribute to this code an earn badges and XP on our [soonaverse.com project](https://soonaverse.com/space/0x9dd831f7eed22ca73b254422baab74a8c460e438/awards).

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### React Component Library

We have a Library with all shared [IOTABOTS components](https://github.com/iotabots/nft-ui-components) - published on npmjs.com: [@iotabots/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iotabots/components). This library contains several components to quickly and efficiently build new applications within the IOTABOTS design.

### Storybook

On top of Material UI's base ui components we have custom shared UI components for the iotabots team and community. These can be found in Storybook [Live Preview Page](https://iotabots.github.io/nft-ui-components/?path=/story/example-introduction--page)

### Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

```bash
yarn dev
```

after that, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
